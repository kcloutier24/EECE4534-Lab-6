## Release 0.1 Documentation

In post-lab update the README.md (both kaudio and usermode-player) to
include: project description, installation/make instructions, usage
definition and usage examples. Treat this stage of implementation as
version 0.1 of both modules. Add a discussion section to the README to
reflect on any challenges and pitfalls.

Update the repository README.md (which currently includes the ALSA audio
instructions) into a project overview across the three introduced
modules (with links to the respective directories).
