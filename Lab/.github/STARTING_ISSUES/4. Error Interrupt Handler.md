## Error Interrupt Handler

1.  Next, we will use the interrupt handler for error handling. The
    interrupt handler is already registered in the skeleton code.
    However, the handler function `esl_audio_irq_handler` is empty.
    Extend the handler to distinguish the interrupt reason (based on
    FIFO status) and identify TX ERROR interrupt(s). See the AXI FIFO
    datasheet for the description of those interrupt flags and what is
    necessary in order to perform correct error handling of different
    errors. After handling, donâ€™t forget to clear the interrupt at the
    AXI FIFO.

2.  Validate that your error handling works. For this, uncomment the
    FIFO full test in the write function, which then should trigger a
    Transmit Packet Overrun Error. Validate that the interrupt is
    triggered.
