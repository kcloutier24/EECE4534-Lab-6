The previous assignments used shell commands to interface with the character device. The same access is also possible from C, which will be used for our audio driver. 

1. Copy from the lab5-pre skeleton the Makefile into the directory *echo_user*
2. In the *echo_user* file, create a file *echo_user.c*. You can copy relevant parts of the lab5-pre skeleton C file. Add and commit the added files to the repository as a starting point.
3. Update the Makefile to compile echo_user.c. For this change the definition of the variables *TARGET* and *SRCS*
4. Implement a minimal user level program to write "Hello from C" to /dev/echo0. 
5. Validate your implementation. Document observations in the issue.
7. Commit (reference the issue in the commit message), and close the issue.
