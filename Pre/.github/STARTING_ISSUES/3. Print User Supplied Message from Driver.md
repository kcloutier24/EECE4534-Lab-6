The next aim is to print the user supplied message in the echo driver. 
For this you will need to copy data from the user space 
into kernel space.
The following steps are for implemeting the *echo_write()* function.

1. Create a local character array of 32 bytes (call it e.g. *print_buf*). 
2. Copy the data from user space into kernel space using [copy_from_user](https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API---copy-from-user.html). See also [User space memory access from the Linux kernel](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-kernel-memory-access/).
3. Print the content of the buffer using `printk()`
4. Validate correct functionality using: ```echo Hello > /dev/echo0```
5. Reason what happens if the user writes a message larger than 32 characters into the device. Note your observations in the issue. List restrictions as comment above the *copy_from_user* call.
6. Commit (reference the issue in the commit message), and close the issue.
